Description:
 Measurement of inclusive jet, dijet and trijet cross sections in ep
 collisions  with the H1 deterctor at HERA. The scattered electron has
 momentum transfer in the range $5.5<Q^2<80$ GeV$^2$ and inelasticity
 $0.2<y<0.6$. For low jet transverse momenta $5<P_T<7$ GeV there are also 
 measurements at high momentum transfer $150<Q^2<15000$ GeV$^2$.
 All distributions are corrected for electroweak and
 radiative effects, so radiation of ISR and FSR photons off the
 electron line must be disabled in the MC generators, as well as Z-exchange.
 Jets are reconstructed from all final state particles excluding the
 electron, after boosting to the Breit frame. The KT jet algorithm
 with radius $R=1$ and the massless PT recombination scheme is
 used. Jets which have a pseudorapidity in the laboratory frame
 outside the range $2.5<\eta_{lab}<-1.0$ are discarded. Jet cross
 sections are measured double-differentially in the momentum transfer
 $Q^2$ and in jet transverse momenta in the Breit frame. Inclusive jet
 production cross sections are measured in the transverse momentum
 range $4.5<p_{t,jet}<50$ GeV. Dijet (Trijet) cross sections are
 measured as a function of the average transverse momenta  of the two
 (three) leading jets. For dijets, the average transverse momenta
 range is $5<\langle p_{T}\rangle_2<50$ GeV, wheras for Trijets the
 range is $5.5<\langle p_{T}\rangle_3<40$ GeV. In addition to
 measuring absolute cross sections, also cross section normalized to
 inclusive DIS (i.e. jet production rates in DIS) are measured.
 The data are expected to be sensitive to parton shower moddeling,
 higher order perturbative QCD effects, the guon density and the
 strong coupling.
